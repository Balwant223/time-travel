# TIME TRAVEL 

I know it sound fake but it works ! So you got your dirty hands on this but this dosent mean it will always work :smiling_imp: . HAHAHA!! But if it works you should I emphasis at ***should*** bring you back in one piece . I am not responsible if your torso dosent come with you . You might have symptoms of smelling choco fudge where nothing is actually there . But there is a good side , you can time travel to the futere and tell us if we (in 2021 or 2022) found anything . I am saying that because i havent tested it , but it should 90%  work . 

## Requirements 
All you need is python and a PC . Run the time-travel.bat for Windows , but for Mac run 
```
python 
```
and copy-paste code from [main.py](https://github.com/PalPalash/time-travel/blob/master/main.py) like
```
python 
import time 
from os import system
import requests
import secrets
 ...............................
```
so on .........

BTW dont try to be smart and save the python files and ##then run it in Command Prompt . That will not work !
